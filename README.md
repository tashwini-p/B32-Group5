# BOOTSTRAP AND FIGMA PROJECT
Welcome to our WEB204 Construct Week Project! 
This project was a collaborative effort which was made over a span of 5 days with a team of 5 members and consists of 2 parts. 

**Part 1: Cosmos- All Things Cosmetics**

In the initial phase of our project, we undertook the creation of a replica of Sugar Cosmetics, and we've aptly named this segment "Cosmos- All Things Cosmetics." The primary objective of this endeavor was to showcase our proficiency in Bootstrap, presenting a refined yet compelling emulation of Sugar Cosmetics. We infused a touch of creativity by making subtle modifications to the design, and to ensure originality, we crafted a unique logo in-house to sidestep any potential copyright concerns.

Our chosen **tech-stack** for this phase remained exclusively front-end, employing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. By focusing on these technologies, we aimed to demonstrate not only our mastery in foundational web development languages but also our ability to leverage frameworks like Bootstrap to streamline the creation of a visually appealing and responsive cosmetic website.

**Part 2: Figma - a Pixel Perfect, Responsive Design**


The second phase of our project involved replicating a webpage based on a provided template using Figma, a tool designed for developers to craft precise web designs. This webpage was meticulously adapted to be responsive on mobile screens.

For this part of the project, our **tech-stack** was exclusively front-end, relying on HTML and SASS, a robust preprocessor for cascading style sheets. The decision to employ SASS was driven by its extensive features, such as mixins and partials, which we effectively utilized to achieve a flawlessly detailed design.
