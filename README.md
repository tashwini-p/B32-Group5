# BOOTSTRAP AND FIGMA PROJECT
Welcome to our WEB204 Construct Week Project! 
This project was a collaborative effort which was made over a span of 5 days with a team of 5 members and consists of 2 parts. 

**Part 1: Cosmos- All Things Cosmetics**

The first part of our project consists of a clone of Sugar Cosmetics. We have named this part of the project as "Cosmos- All Things Cosmetics". The purpose of creating this website was to put our skills in Bootstrap to the test and create a simple, yet convincing clone of Sugar Cosmetics, while also adding in our creativity to modify it a little. The logo has been replaced with a logo that was created by us in order to avoid copyright issues. 

The **techstack** that was used was purely front-end based and limited to HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

**Part 2: Figma - a Pixel Perfect, Responsive Design**


The second phase of our project involved replicating a webpage based on a provided template using Figma, a tool designed for developers to craft precise web designs. This webpage was meticulously adapted to be responsive on mobile screens.

For this part of the project, our **tech-stack** was exclusively front-end, relying on HTML and SASS, a robust preprocessor for cascading style sheets. The decision to employ SASS was driven by its extensive features, such as mixins and partials, which we effectively utilized to achieve a flawlessly detailed design.
